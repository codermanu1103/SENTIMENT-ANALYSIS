MENTOR - NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

Description:

ðŸ”¹ 1. Importing Libraries
The notebook starts by importing key Python libraries:
numpy and matplotlib for numerical operations and plotting.
sklearn modules for:
Loading datasets (load_files)
Preprocessing (TfidfVectorizer)
Modeling (LogisticRegression)
Evaluation (accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report)

ðŸ”¹ 2. Loading the IMDb Dataset
Loads the IMDb movie reviews dataset from the aclImdb/train folder.
It uses only two categories: pos (positive) and neg (negative).
The text data (X) and labels (y) are extracted from files.
Prints the total number of positive and negative reviews loaded.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
Applies TfidfVectorizer to convert reviews into a numeric format suitable for ML models.
Uses a vocabulary of the top 5,000 features and removes English stopwords.
Splits the dataset into:
X_train, y_train for training
X_val, y_val for validation (80-20 split)

ðŸ”¹ 4. Training the Logistic Regression Model
Initializes a LogisticRegression model with max_iter=1000.
Fits the model using the training data.
Predicts sentiments (y_pred) on the validation set.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Evaluating the Model
Calculates and prints:
Accuracy Score of the predictions.
Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score).
Confusion Matrix to visualize prediction performance.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Identifying Important Words
Extracts the modelâ€™s coefficients for each word (feature).
Identifies:
Top 10 positive words with the highest coefficients.
Top 10 negative words with the lowest coefficients.
Helps interpret which words strongly influence sentiment predictions.

ðŸ”¹ 7. Testing on Unseen IMDb Data
Loads aclImdb/test data (new, unseen reviews).
Transforms the test reviews using the same TF-IDF vectorizer.
Predicts sentiments on the test set.
Prints the test accuracy, showing how well the model generalizes.

ðŸ”¹ 8. Output & Insights
The model achieves solid performance on both validation and test sets.
Positive and negative influential words provide explainability.
The notebook shows a full ML pipeline for sentiment classification.
